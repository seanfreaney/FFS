# FFS

I am a chartered accountant by current profession and qualified in 2022 under Chartered Accountants Ireland. Since then I have been working in finance in the Fin Tech industry but I have always toyed with the idea of starting my own business. This served as the inspiration for FFS - Freaney Financial Services.

My Goal was to create a website that would allow me to provide a range of services to potential clients. The initial offering would be preparation of monthly management accounts preparation however I would like to expand this to include other services in the future. In order to facilitate the process of providing these services, I needed to create a website that would allow me to simply share data with clients in a secure and efficient manner.
