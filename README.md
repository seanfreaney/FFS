# FFS

I am a chartered accountant by current profession and qualified in 2022 under Chartered Accountants Ireland. Since then I have been working in finance in the Fin Tech industry but I have always toyed with the idea of starting my own business. This served as the inspiration for FFS - Freaney Financial Services.

My Goal was to create a website that would allow me to provide a range of services to potential clients. The initial offering would be preparation of monthly management accounts preparation however I would like to expand this to include other services in the future. In order to facilitate the process of providing these services, I needed to create a website that would allow me to simply share data with clients in a secure and efficient manner.

## Design

### Wire Frames

It was my intention to keep the design as simple as possible. Initially, i only envisaged a two or three page website. However, as I started to develop the project, I realised that I would need to create more pages and views to manage the functionality that I want to offer to users.

#### FFS Wireframes

- Home
![Homepage Wireframe](assets/images/wire-home.png)

- Management View
![Management View Wireframe](assets/images/wire-mgmt.png)

- Make Request
![Create Service Request Wireframe](assets/images/wire-make-request.png)

- Profile
![Profile Wireframe](assets/images/wire-profile.png)

- Request Detail
![Request Detail Wireframe](assets/images/wire-request-detail.png)

## Models

The creation of my wireframes provided a basis for the site's models. I have used Django's default user model. As i began to develop the project, I realised that I would need to create additional models to manage the different aspects of the site.

## Model Relationships

### User Model (Django Built-in) Relationships

Django User Model is the central model with connections to:

1. UserProfile (One-to-One)
   - Each User has exactly one UserProfile
   - Created automatically via signal when User is created
   - Relationship defined in UserProfile model:
     user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

2. ServiceRequest (One-to-Many)
   - One User can have many ServiceRequests
   - Relationship defined in ServiceRequest model:
     user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

3. Document (One-to-Many)
   - One User can upload many Documents
   - Tracks document uploader
   - Relationship defined in Document model:
     uploaded_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)


### ServiceRequest Model Relationships

ServiceRequest connects to:

1. User (Many-to-One)
   - Many ServiceRequests can belong to one User
   - Deleting a User deletes all their ServiceRequests (CASCADE)

2. Document (One-to-Many)
   - One ServiceRequest can have multiple Documents
   - Relationship defined in Document model:
     service_request = models.ForeignKey(ServiceRequest, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
   - Accessible via 'documents' related name:
     service_request.documents.all()


### Document Model Relationships

Document connects to:

1. ServiceRequest (Many-to-One)
   - Many Documents can belong to one ServiceRequest
   - Deleting a ServiceRequest deletes all associated Documents (CASCADE)

2. User (Many-to-One)
   - Many Documents can be uploaded by one User
   - If User is deleted, uploaded_by becomes NULL (SET_NULL)


### NewsletterSubscriber Model

- Standalone model with no relationships to other models
- Stores unique email addresses independently


### Key Points:
1. Deletion Behavior:
   - Deleting a User cascades to delete their Profile and ServiceRequests
   - Deleting a ServiceRequest cascades to delete its Documents
   - Deleting a User nullifies their Document uploads rather than deleting them

2. Access Patterns:
   - User → Profile: user.userprofile
   - User → ServiceRequests: user.servicerequest_set.all()
   - ServiceRequest → Documents: service_request.documents.all()
   - Document → ServiceRequest: document.service_request
   - Document → Uploader: document.uploaded_by

## E-Commerce Functionality

## Frontend Implementation (stripe_element.js)

### Initial Setup and DOM Checks

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
const paymentForm = document.getElementById('payment-form');
const cardElement = document.getElementById('card-element');
if (paymentForm && cardElement) {
console.log('Stripe Public Key:', stripePublicKey);
```

This section:
- Ensures DOM is fully loaded before initialization
- Checks for payment form elements
- Validates required Stripe keys are present

### Stripe Elements Configuration

```javascript
const stripe = Stripe(stripePublicKey);
const elements = stripe.elements();
const card = elements.create('card');
card.mount('#card-element');
```

This section:
- Configures Stripe elements
- Creates card element
- Mounts card element to the DOM

### Real-time Card Validation

```javascript
card.on('change', function(event) {
const displayError = document.getElementById('card-errors');
if (event.error) {
displayError.textContent = event.error.message;
} else {
displayError.textContent = '';
}
});
```

Provides:
- Instant feedback on card input
- Validation for:
  - Card number format
  - Expiry date validity
  - CVC format
  - Card type recognition
- Real-time error messages

### Payment Form Submission

```javascript
paymentForm.addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
e.preventDefault();
paymentButton.disabled = true;
try {
// Create Payment Intent
const response = await fetch(createPaymentIntentUrl, {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken
}
});
const data = await response.json();
if (data.error) {
handleError(data.error);
return;
}
// Confirm Payment
const { error, paymentIntent } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(
data.clientSecret,
{
payment_method: { card: card }
}
);
```

Handles:
- Form submission prevention
- Double-submission protection
- Payment Intent creation
- CSRF protection
- Error catching and handling

### Comprehensive Error Handling

```javascript
if (error) {
console.error('Payment error:', error);
const errorDiv = document.getElementById('card-errors');
errorDiv.textContent = error.message;
errorDiv.classList.add('alert', 'alert-danger');
paymentButton.disabled = false;
} else {
if (paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {
handleSuccess(data.requestNumber);
} else {
handleUnexpectedStatus(paymentIntent.status);
}
}
```

Manages:
- Card processing errors
- Network failures
- Server response errors
- Unexpected payment states
- User feedback display

## Webhook Implementation (webhooks.py)

### Endpoint Configuration and Decorators

```python
@require_POST
@csrf_exempt
def webhook(request):
"""Listen for webhooks from Stripe"""
wh_secret = settings.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
```

Purpose:
- Restricts to POST requests only
- Bypasses CSRF for Stripe webhooks
- Configures Stripe credentials

### Webhook Data Extraction and Verification

``` python
payload = request.body
sig_header = request.META['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE']
event = None
try:
event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
payload, sig_header, wh_secret
)
except ValueError as e:
" # Invalid payload format" 
return HttpResponse(content=str(e), status=400)
except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError as e:
" # Invalid signature" 
return HttpResponse(content=str(e), status=400)
except Exception as e:
" # Generic error handling" 
return HttpResponse(content=str(e), status=400)
```

Handles:
- Raw webhook payload extraction
- Signature header retrieval
- Event construction
- Three levels of error catching:
  1. Malformed payload
  2. Invalid signature
  3. Unexpected errors

### Event Routing System

```python
handler = StripeWH_Handler(request)
event_map = {
'payment_intent.succeeded': handler.handle_payment_intent_succeeded,
'payment_intent.payment_failed': handler.handle_payment_intent_payment_failed,
}
event_type = event['type']
event_handler = event_map.get(event_type, handler.handle_event)
response = event_handler(event)
```

Provides:
- Handler instance creation
- Event type mapping
- Fallback handling
- Response processing

## Webhook Handler Implementation (webhook_handler.py)

### Handler Class Initialization

```python
class StripeWH_Handler:
"""Handle Stripe webhooks"""
def init(self, request):
self.request = request
```

Purpose:
- Creates handler instance
- Stores request context
- Enables request access in handlers

### Generic Event Handler


```python
def handle_event(self, event):
"""Handle generic event"""
return HttpResponse(content=str(event), status=200)
``` 

Manages:
- Unknown event types
- Logging opportunities
- Default responses

### Successful Payment Handler

```python
def handle_payment_intent_succeeded(self, event):
"""Handle successful payment confirmation"""
intent = event.data.object
request_number = intent.metadata.request_number
try:
# Locate service request
service_request = ServiceRequest.objects.get(
request_number=request_number,
stripe_payment_intent_id=intent.id
)
# Update payment status
service_request.mark_as_paid()
print(f"Payment confirmed for request {request_number}")
return HttpResponse(
content=f'Webhook received: {event["type"]} | SUCCESS: Payment confirmed',
status=200)
except ServiceRequest.DoesNotExist:
print(f"Service request not found: {request_number}")
return HttpResponse(
content=f'Webhook received: {event["type"]} | ERROR: Service request not found',
status=404)
except Exception as e:
return HttpResponse(
content=f'Webhook received: {event["type"]} | ERROR: {str(e)}',
status=500)
```

Handles:
- Payment intent extraction
- Request number retrieval
- Database record location
- Payment status updates
- Error scenarios:
  - Missing records
  - Database errors
  - General exceptions
- Logging and debugging
- Status responses

### Failed Payment Handler

```python
def handle_payment_intent_payment_failed(self, event):
"""Handle failed payment notification"""
return HttpResponse(
content=f'Webhook received: {event["type"]}',
status=200)
```

Manages:
- Failed payment logging
- Error notification opportunities
- Status acknowledgment

## Helper Methods and Utilities

### Payment Status Update

```python
def mark_as_paid(self):
"""Update service request payment status"""
self.is_paid = True
self.paid_at = timezone.now()
self.save()
```

Handles:
- Payment status flag
- Timestamp recording
- Database updates

### Error Handling Utilities

```python
def handleError(error):
"""Process and display error messages"""
console.error('Error:', error);
const errorDiv = document.getElementById('card-errors');
errorDiv.textContent = error.message;
errorDiv.classList.add('alert', 'alert-danger');
paymentButton.disabled = false;
```

Provides:
- Error logging
- User feedback
- UI updates

## Unfixed Bugs

- I am unable to get static files pushed to S3 on my deployed site. I have tried several times and have been unable to resolve the issue. I have used the instructions from the Code Institute walkthrough project as well looking at documentation on AWS. Unfortunately This means that the user and management will not be able to upload and download their documents as desired. I understand that this is not ideal, however, I believe that the site is sufficiently functional to facilitate a platform for a small accounting company to manage customers and take payment for services while sharing documents with the customer over email..

## Additional Features

- Implement static file storage on AWS S3.
- Implement testimonials section to allow customers to provide reviews.
- Add a question and answer section in the request detail page to allow users and management to interact and communicatewithin the site.
- Add invoice creation and management to the management dashboard and allow users to view and download invoices. Currently it could be assumed that invoices would be shared with the customer over email.
